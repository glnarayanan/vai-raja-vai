## Plot Summary

Ramachandramurthy alias Ram. C. M, is an Indian pilot based in Canada and a womanizer. One day, in the course of an aircraft hijacking, he meets a passenger named Mythili. Ram and Mythili stop the hijacking and save the passengers. Soon after, they fall in love and get married. Ram's four closest friends, Ayyapan Nair, Vedhantham Iyer alias Vedham, Ganesh Hegde, and Hanumanth Reddy, attend their wedding reception.

After marriage, Ram quits his playboy character and remains faithful to Mythili. One day, when Ram prevents Hegde's ex-girlfriend, Nirmala, from committing suicide, Mythili misinterprets the situation as Ram having an affair with Nirmala. She then leaves him to be with her parents. Further misunderstanding occurs when he sets out to meet Mythili, drunk, in the middle of the night and enters the wrong room.

To take his mind off Mythili for a while, Ram's friends drive him down to Bengaluru and rent a room to hire a call girl named Maragathavalli, alias Maggie, on Ram's birthday. Ram, who is still not able to forget Mythili and does not wish to betray her, gets into a fight with Maggie. To salvage the situation, Vedham hurries back to Maggie's room, only to find Maggie dead. Panicking, Nair, Vedham, Hegde, and Reddy decide to discreetly dispose of the body in spite of Ram's pleas to call the police. They manage to roll the body in a blanket, dispose of it in a dry river and drive back to Chennai to return to their normal lives.

Ram discovers a cache of diamonds inside Maggie's mobile phone. He decides to find the real murderer with the diamonds. A few days later, the friends get very nervous when they learn of a news article regarding the discovery of a corpse in the same area where they disposed of Maggie's body. At that time, the wives of Ram's four friends plan to unite Ram and Mythili by holding a party at the traditional festival of Ugadi at Reddy's house. The wives invite Mythili to the party to be reunited with Ram.

At the party, Maggie appears, demanding her diamonds back. Maggie then reveals the truth behind her death. The diamonds belong to a smuggler, and she stole them from him for personal gain. She chose to merely fake her death as she realized that the diamonds would be temporarily safe in Ram's possession. She also blackmails Ram, saying that she will reveal the truth about their rendezvous in Bangalore to Mythili and their wives if he does not give the diamonds back. The smuggler then arrives and kidnaps Maggie, Ram, and his friends. Mythili spots Ram and Maggie together. She again believes that Ram has not changed his ways. Mythili, along with an undercover police inspector, follows them.

While the smuggler demands his diamonds back, Mythili appears with the undercover inspector. Upon seeing Ram and Maggie together, she believes that Ram is hugging Maggie, when in reality Ram, Maggie and his friends, are being held captive by the smuggler. She swallows some sleeping pills, which turns out to be where Ram hid the diamonds. Mythili decides to commit suicide and goes to a bridge. After finding out that Mythili swallowed the diamonds, Maggie and the smuggler try to save her and take the diamonds, but they get arrested by the undercover inspector and the police. Ram manages to save Mythili. After overhearing the conversation between Ram and his friends about what has happened, Mythili promises to reform her suspicious ways. The two then reunite.
